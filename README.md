User Stories
As a potential client, I want to browse the photographer’s gallery so I can see sample work before deciding to hire them.
As a visitor, I want to easily find the photographer’s contact information or a contact form so I can inquire about booking a session.
As a returning client, I want to read about the photographer’s background and experience so I feel confident in their expertise.
